Home Price Prediction Web App
This project is a web application that predicts the price of a home based on various input features such as the total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and the location. The application leverages a simple price prediction model to provide estimates for home prices based on these parameters.

Features
User Input: Users can enter details such as total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), number of bathrooms, and select the location from a predefined list.
Price Prediction: The app calculates the estimated price of the home based on the entered details and displays the result.
Backend: The backend is built using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. It handles the user requests, processes the data, and returns the estimated home price.
Frontend: The frontend is built using basic HTML and JavaScript with the jQuery library to handle AJAX requests to the backend and dynamically update the page with the estimated price.
